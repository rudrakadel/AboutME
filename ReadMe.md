<h2 align="center">💫 A Bit About Me 🚀</h2>

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Script-Kiddie-JKB/Script-Kiddie-JKB/main/Assets/programmer.gif" alt="That's pretty much me!" />

So, you've stumbled upon my little corner of GitHub! Welcome! I'm a BTech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering, and I've got a thing for Cybersecurity. It's not just a job for me – it's a passion. I love diving deep into the digital realm, finding vulnerabilities, and patching them up before the bad guys can exploit them.

Here's what I'm all about:
- 🔒 I've got a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles (because someone's gotta keep the internet safe, right?)
- 🐍 I wield Python like a digital sword against security threats
- 🧠 I enjoy tackling complex security puzzles (it's like solving a mystery, but with code!)
- 🤖 Lately, I've been exploring how AI can make cybersecurity even cooler
- 📊 I'm also into making sure everything's compliant (because rules can be fun too... sometimes)

Right now, I'm leveling up my skills with the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera. Always learning, always growing! And hey, if you've got an exciting project that needs a security enthusiast, I'm all ears!

<h2 align="center">🔑 Cool Stuff I've Worked On 💡</h2>

- **Deepfake Detective**: I built a model that can spot those tricky AI-generated videos. Take that, disinformation!
- **Career Counselor Chatbot**: Created an AI buddy to help folks figure out their career path. It's like a guidance counselor, but in your pocket!
- **Machine Learning Playground**: I've built and deployed various ML models. It's like teaching computers to think – how cool is that?
- **Digital Fort Knox**: I regularly participate in Capture The Flag challenges. It's like playing digital hide-and-seek with other security geeks!

<h2 align="center">👨‍💻 Where I've Honed My Skills 🛠️</h2>

1. **Mastercard's Cybersecurity Boot Camp**: Played the role of a security analyst, learned how to spot threats, and even got to train others. It was like being a digital superhero!

2. **J.P. Morgan's Code Clinic**: Fixed up their digital toolbox and created some nifty data visualization graphs. It was like being a code doctor and an artist rolled into one!

3. **AICTE & Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Bootcamp**: Got my hands dirty with Cloud Security, Network Security, and Security Ops. It was like learning to build and defend digital castles!

<h2 align="center">🌟 Bragging Rights (Just a Little!) 🏅</h2>

- 🏆 Snagged four Google Cloud Skill Badges, including the Level 3 GenAI badge. It's like collecting digital Pokemon, but for tech skills!
- 🎤 At DevFest Kolkata 23, I got to pick the brains of industry bigwigs and even had a chat with Striver. Talk about a fanboy moment!
